## Development Notes

This initial release represents a complete implementation of the Microsoft 365 Analyst Agent with all major features functional. The codebase is structured for maintainability and extensibility, with clear separation between data integration, analysis, visualization, collaboration, and automation concerns.

The extension has been designed to work seamlessly within the VS Code ecosystem while providing powerful data analysis capabilities that rival dedicated analytics tools, but with the convenience of being integrated into a developer's primary IDE.
